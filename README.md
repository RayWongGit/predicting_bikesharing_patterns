# Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
## Introduction
In this project, we build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, we'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know. We train the neural network model and then test its performance on the bike-sharing dataset. 

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).
